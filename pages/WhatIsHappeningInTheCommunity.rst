CentOS Packages in IUS Community Repositories
=============================================

*Jeffrey Ness* @ *March 25th 2013*

With the addition of libjpeg-turbo by Redhat `RHEA-2013:0422`_ and the fact
that `CentOS`_ is not always inline with the current Redhat release,
IUS Community has decided to build CentOS packages along side the existing
Redhat Enterprise Linux packages.

These packages can be viewed in the existing repositories along side their
Redhat counterparts:
