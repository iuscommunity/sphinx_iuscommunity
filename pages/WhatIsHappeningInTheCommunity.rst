RaspberryPi Packaging
=====================

*Jeffrey Ness* @ *April 1st 2013*

The IUS Community is happy to announce we've just received our new
infrastructure, and are preparing to begin packaging Enterprise Linux packages
for the `RaspberryPi`_ platform.

I know what you may be thinking, who uses `RaspberryPi`_ as a hardware platform
for Enterprise Linux? Well we at the IUS Community believe this miniature
hardware may be the future of running large scale applications.

SD cards now days are upwards to tens if not hundreds of megabytes,
once Enterprise Linux is loaded this will leave you multiple megabytes to
store your databases and applications.

Stay tuned for more information on this miniature news!


CentOS Packages in IUS Community Repositories
=============================================

*Jeffrey Ness* @ *March 25th 2013*

With the addition of libjpeg-turbo by Redhat `RHEA-2013:0422`_ and the fact
that `CentOS`_ is not always inline with the current Redhat release,
IUS Community has decided to build CentOS packages along side the existing
Redhat Enterprise Linux packages.

These packages can be viewed in the existing repositories along side their
Redhat counterparts:
