    Imagine being able to combine the rock-solid stability of RedHat Enterprise
    Linux (or Oracle, Centos, Scientific) with the latest versions of popular
    software packages like PHP, Python, MySQL, mod_wsgi, redis, and others?

    The IUS Community Project is the answer.

    Enterprise Linux is great for the stability, security, and compatibility.
    But sometimes you need a newer version of an installed package, like Python.
    At the time of this writing, RedHat is still not providing any standard way
    to obtain Python 3.2, MySQL 5.5, or PHP 5.4, years after they have been
    released.

    The IUS Community project has provided AppCove, Inc. and all of our clients
    the perfect mix of stability and functionality.  IUS has enabled us to focus
    on our core competencies (software development) while being confident that t
    he packages we use are as secure and up-to-date as possible.

    Our confidence in the IUS team is second to none.  AppCove has worked in
    close conjunction with the IUS team on several occasions, and they have
    always been impeccably experienced, knowledgeable, and professional. 

    We highly recommend that any users of RedHat Enterprise Linux, Oracle
    Enterprise Linux, Scientific Linux, or Centos Linux take a close look at the
    IUS Community Project for their servers.
