Installing Packages
===================

Packages can be downloaded directly, however it is recommended to set up
your Yum client configurations to point to our repositories and install via yum.
We have a package called 'ius-release' that does all this for you.
See the :ref:`GettingStarted` page.

Please note that we are still just getting started, and will be adding more
repositories in the future.
